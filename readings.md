## Week 1

### Electronic Literature: What is it?

### The Gathering Cloud
Interactive and informative. Felt like a museum or educational website, the popup areas of further information was really effective at a digital version of footnotes.

## Depression Quest
Played this a few years ago and had a very unsavoury experience. Gave it a skip this time. The game uses false and eroding choices to deny the player/reader agency as they navigate the story. The lack of any real choices is extremely effective at evoking the feeling of pereptual futility that comes with depression.  


As someone who suffers from depression, I found it far too effective at relaying the experience and could only make it so far into the game.

However, I think it is an excelent example of utilising the format of digital writing in a way that traditional writing simply would not be able to replicate.
