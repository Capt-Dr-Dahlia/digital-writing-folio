## Week 1

### Electronic Literature: What is it?

### The Gathering Cloud
Interactive and informative. Felt like a museum or educational website, the popup areas of further information was really effective at a digital version of footnotes.

## Depression Quest
Played this a few years ago and had a very unsavoury experience. Gave it a skip this time. The game uses false and eroding choices to deny the player/reader agency as they navigate the story. The lack of any real choices is extremely effective at evoking the feeling of pereptual futility that comes with depression.  


As someone who suffers from depression, I found it far too effective at relaying the experience and could only make it so far into the game.

However, I think it is an excelent example of utilising the format of digital writing in a way that traditional writing simply would not be able to replicate.

## Chapter 13. Hypertext Fiction Ever After
Stuart Moulthrop

An interesting and concise exploration of the history of hypertext fiction that analyses its relationship with other forms of media. I critical, historical analysis like this are extremely important in helping a writer understand the social/economic/political/artistic dynamics and impportance of their medium. I found the dialectical relationship between hypertext and twine, and twine and games very intersting. Twine's influence as a platform on depression Quest the unfrotunate involvement of bothin the 'gamergate' era really highlight the tangled web of medium with the material world. This is especially tru given the various lines that can, and have, been drawn between the gamergate movement, Nick Bannon, and Trumps election.

### however

As someone who is still very new to the medium of hypertect fiction, and certainly twine, none of these analysis could really benefit my main needs right now: which is the craft of writing digital interactive fiction. Understanding a mediums place in history, and the world is important to understand, but i would like to become good at writing it before i start worrying about that.

## On Savoir-Faire 
Chapter Author: Short, Emily

Super interesting -- in theory. The possibilities seem really creative and 'outside the box.' However, wiuthout having played the game, i worry it would fall into the trap that alot of point and click adventure games have in the past. Many of these peices of fiction become excercises in combining every object with evey other object. Try the wrench with the paintball gun, try the wrench on Judy, try the wrench with the bowling ball. Click on every single thing on screen, then use the hat in your inventory on every single thing on screen - an excercise in: guess what the writer was thinking.
