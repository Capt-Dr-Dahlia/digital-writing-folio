# Reflections

### Spaces
No code on this website will work if there are spaces between words. What year is it? how is this still something coders haven't figured out?

### 8/5/2023
The technical elements of this course are probably the most difficult. Even though its designed for babies to understand, sometimes i miss a simple element that hyjacks my time for hours. Would probably be easier if i had the enrergy to attended more classes/ Focusing on the writing parts for now since that can all be done on google docs.

### Note taking
Since alot of my readings were done at home, i took all my notes on paper and now regret it as i have to slowly type them up.
