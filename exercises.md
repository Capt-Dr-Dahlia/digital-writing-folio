## Week 1

- [ ] Crete a GitHub account
- [ ] Do the GitHub 'Hello World'
- [ ] Add a repository to for the folio
- [ ] What types of writing do you do?
- [ ] What tools or techniques do you use?
- [ ] How do these tools shape the way you write?


### What types of writing do you do?

- Poetry focusing on themes of queerness, dperession, and class, leaning into and learning from the surrealist/afro-surrealist style.
- Whimsical sapphic fantasy fiction, inspired by studio Ghibli films, fairytales.
- Cyberpunk fiction, attempting to incorporate poetry into/inbetween the story. What does poetry written in a dystopian future look like? how do people write in 100 years? how do the styles differ from now and from others within the society?
- Jazz vampires?
- Body horror/lovecraftian stories as alllegory for class conflict, transness, change. Inspired by Junji Ito, Hideteki Miyazaki, HP. Lovecraft, John Carpenter, David Cronenberg.
 
 
### What tools or techniques do you you use? Why?

- pen and paper for poetry allows me to be changable/malliable. Its easy to cross out a word, draw an arrow indicating a change in structure, Etc. The poem becomes like a piece of clay to be moulded into its base shape and content. Only then can it be translated onto a word document to be edited and finely altered.
- Word document for fiction. Multiple versions for each pass of an edit.
- Changing the text font on occasion can help to see the writing in a slightly new lens.
- Listen to music on headphones. No lyrics, as words will disract. If neccisary i will use heavy death metal or white noise as they are the best at blocking out sensory distractions and forcing my mind to narrow in and focus.


### How do these tools shape the way you write?

- Most poems are written to fit on a single A4 sheet of paper.
- Most fiction is written to conform to chapters of a book.
- The ease and pervasiveness of spell check and grammar check encourage me to under-write and can be distracting from getting a lot of writing out.


## Week 2


### What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?

- I read The popup areas with additional information

### How are those elements meaningful?

- Like footnotes in print writing, they allows the writer to convey additional information without taking the reader out of the pages/windows tone and context.

### How are the works read differently from print literature? How is electronic literature different from print literature? What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?

- More interactive, and able to include other forms of media such as music and motion/film. The automated animated elements create a sense of momentum and change that involve the reader.


### Create a constraint (a restriction on your writing such as not using the letter "e" or a set number of syllables)

Each line must adhere to a predetermined and randomised amount of syllables.

### Create a process (a process for creating writing such as picking the third word of each page of a book)

Every third noun is replaced by an option in the thesaurus for that word.

## Taroko Gorge Remix

### What aspects of the remix are the same?

The way the words are generated and flow down the screen remain the same.

### What aspects of the remix are different?

The words themselves and the tone.

### Is the remix successful (why or why not)?

not really, it didn;t really have the same synergy and coherency of words and mood due to less thought out word choices.
