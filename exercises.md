### What types of writing do you do?

- Poetry focusing on themes of queerness, dperession, and class, leaning into and learning from the surrealist/afro-surrealist style.
- Whimsical sapphic fantasy fiction, inspired by studio Ghibli films, fairytales.
- Cyberpunk fiction, attempting to incorporate poetry into/inbetween the story. What does poetry written in a dystopian future look like? how do people write in 100 years? how do the styles differ from now and from others within the society?
- Jazz vampires?
- Body horror/lovecraftian stories as alllegory for class conflict, transness, change. Inspired by Junji Ito, Hidetaki Miyozaki, HP. Lovecraft, John Carpenter, David Cronenberg.
 
### What tools or techniques do you you use?

- pen and paper for poetry allows me to be changable/malliable. Its easy to cross out a word, draw an arrow indicating a change in structure, Etc.
- Word document for fiction. Multiple versions for each pass of an edit.
- Changing the text font on occasion can help to see the writing in a slightly new lens.
- Listen to music on headphones. No lyrics, as words will disract. If neccisary i will use heavy death metal or white noise as they are the best at blocking out sensory distractions and forcing my mind to narrow in and focus.
